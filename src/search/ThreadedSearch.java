       * [50, 75), and [75, 100) as their sections to search.

       * You then construct `numThreads`, each of which is given a different
       * instance of this class as its `Runnable`. Then start each of those
       * threads, wait for them to all terminate, and then return the answer
       * in the shared `Answer` instance.
